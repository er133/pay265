# pay265 — Vercel + Supabase ready frontend

This project is a ready-to-deploy **React (Vite) frontend** for the pay265 marketplace.
It uses **Supabase** for Auth, Database, and Storage.

## Quick steps to deploy (simple, copy/paste)

1. Create a Supabase project (you said you already have an account).
   - In Supabase, go to **Project Settings > API** and copy **URL** and **anon public** key.

2. In your project repository on GitHub, add these files and push to GitHub (or upload the ZIP).

3. In Vercel, import this GitHub repo and **set two Environment Variables**:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = (your Supabase project URL)
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = (your Supabase anon public key)

4. Deploy — Vercel will build and give you a live URL.

## Supabase required tables (run these SQL queries in Supabase SQL editor)

-- products table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  title text NOT NULL,
  price_mwk integer NOT NULL,
  seller_name text,
  district text,
  status text DEFAULT 'available',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- orders table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id bigint REFERENCES products(id),
  buyer_name text,
  method text,
  status text DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- enable Row Level Security if you plan to restrict access later
-- ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

## Environment variables used by the app
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Notes
- This is an MVP frontend: payments are handled by buyer/seller outside the app (proof uploads not implemented here to keep it simple).
- You can enhance it by adding image uploads to Supabase Storage and orders management in the backend.
